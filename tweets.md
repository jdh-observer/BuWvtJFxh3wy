Introducing the Video Reuse Detector üéûÔ∏è
A machine-learning toolkit designed to track the reuse of historic footage across audiovisual archives. Discover how AI is transforming digital history. #digitalhistory #audiovisualheritage #AI #remixculture https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en/article/BuWvtJFxh3wy

How does the Video Reuse Detector work?
It uses convolutional neural networks and similarity searches to detect visual patterns in large video collections, helping researchers trace how footage circulates over time. #videoresearch #machinelearning

Why does audiovisual reuse matter?
Historic footage evolves as it gets reused in new contexts. By analysing these transformations, we can better understand remix culture, media narratives, and digital heritage. #audiovisualreuse #digitalarchives

Beyond detection: VRD as a research tool
The Video Reuse Detector doesn‚Äôt just find copies‚Äîit maps connections between video clips, enabling new ways to explore the "social life" of moving images. #digitalhumanities #AI #remixculture

The future of audiovisual analysis
By integrating AI-driven tools like the Video Reuse Detector, historians and media scholars can redefine how we study and interpret digital archives. Learn more: https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en/article/BuWvtJFxh3wy #digitalhistory #videoresearch
